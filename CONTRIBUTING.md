## Development Setup  

### Prerequisites
- OS: Linux or macOS
- IDE: Android Studio OR VSCode
- Tools: Flutter SDK installed on your machine

### Project Setup
1. Please setup `supertokens-core` by following [this guide](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-core/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-setup). If you are not contributing to `supertokens-core`, please skip  steps 1 & 4 under "Project Setup" section.
2. Clone the forked repository in the parent directory of the previously setup `supertokens-root`. That is, `supertokens-flutter` and `supertokens-root` should exist side by side within the same parent directory.
3. `cd supertokens-flutter`
4. Add git pre-commit hooks
   ```
   ./setup-pre-commit.sh
   ```
5. Ensure all packages are fetched by running `flutter pub get` or by using your IDE shortcut.

## Modifying Code  
1. Open the `supertokens-flutter` project in the IDE of your choice.
2. You can start modifying the code.

## Testing
1. Navigate to the `supertokens-root` repository
2. Start the testing environment
   ```
   ./startTestingEnv --wait
   ```
3. In a new terminal, navigate to the `supertokens-flutter` repository.
4. Install dependencies required for testing
   ```
   cd ./testHelpers/server/
   npm i -d
   ```
5. Start the testing server
   ```
   TEST_MODE=testing INSTALL_PATH=../../../supertokens-root node .
   ```
6. In a new terminal, navigate to the `supertokens-flutter` repository and run all tests
   ```
   flutter test --concurrency=1
   ```

   If you want to run just one test, you can run the following command:
   ```
   flutter test --concurrency=1 test/supertokens_test.dart --name 'Test custom headers for refreshAPI'
   ```
